src is where your dynamic files reside. If the file is imported by your JavaScript application or changes contents, put it here. In order to make sure the client downloads the most up-to-date version of your file instead of relying on a cached copy, Webpack will give changed files a unique file name in the production build. This allows you to use simple, intuitive file names during development, such as banner.png instead of banner-2019-03-01-final.png. You never have to worry about your client using the outdated cached copy, because Webpack will automatically rename banner.png to banner.unique-hash.png, where the unique hash changes only when banner.png changes.
